The standard model has satisfied experimental results in particle physics for 100 years. Many searches in particle physics seek to better understand this standard model, and to analyze theories that expand on it.


The standard model (SM) of particle physics explains electroweak symmetry breaking, the mechanism by which the $Z$ and $W$ bosons become massive. The reason why this scale is much different from the Planck scale (the ``hierarchy problem'') is still unknown. The contributions to the Higgs boson mass that involve top quark loops would diverge if there is not another mechanism to counter them in other beyond-SM (BSM) scenarios. In this analysis, we search for a heavy  $t\bar{t}$ resonances decaying from particles predicted by BSM theories. Some of these BSM models predict extra dimensions, resulting in Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gluons \cite{ExtraDim}. We also look for $Z'$ resonances in leptophobic topcolor models \cite{leptophobicZprime, Zprimettxs, ZprimeCoupledtoGen3, WarpedGaugeBosons}, as well as dark matter (DM) $Z'$ particles \cite{wasmer_dark_matter}.

Chapter 2 discusses the established particle physics theories. Chapter 3 descrinesn the CMS detector whose data the analysis was performed with. Chapter 4 describes how the data from the detector is used to identify particles. Chapter 5 describes the analysis.


In the past, searches at CDF and D0 at the Tevatron, and CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have set limits for heavy $t\bar{t}$ resonances. Experiments conducted at the Tevatron searched for masses up to 900 GeV \cite{cdftt3, d0tt} and experiments at the LHC have searched for masses up to 4 TeV, most recently using Run 2 data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV \cite{7tevZprime_CMSAllHad, 7tevZprime_CMSSemilept, 7tevZprime_ATLASAllHad, 7tevZprime_ATLASSemilept, 8tevZprime_CMSAllHad, 8tevZprime_CMSAllHadSemilept, 8tevZprime_CMSAllHadSemileptLept, 8tevZprime_ATLASSemilept, AN-2016-459}. The CMS and ATLAS searches are categorized by the decay of the W in the $t \rightarrow W b$ decay into all-hadronic, semi-leptonic, and fully-leptonic final states.
