\section{The Tracker}\label{sec:ch3:trk}


At the innermost layer of the detector, held within the 6 meter bore of the solenoid, sits the silicon tracking system. WIth 1000 particles from 20 overlapping collisions bombarding the detector every 25 ns, the tracker needs a high power density system to accurately and precisely measure the tracks of individual charged particles. The high energy particles subject the electronics to high radiation levels. To withstand this over a length of time of now over a decade, silicon was used. The tracker is composed of an inner 3 layers pixel detector, with 10 barrel layers of silicon strip tracking. The tracker was built over the course of over a decade, with the input of hundreds of particle physicists from 51 institutes, including the University at Buffalo.

The information from the tracker is vital to the high level trigger (HLT) decisions, which reduce the rate of incoming collisions data by a factor of 400.
