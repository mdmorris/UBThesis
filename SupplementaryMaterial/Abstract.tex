We present a search for new massive particles decaying to a $t\bar{t}$ pair with 2016, 2017 and 2018
ultra-legacy Run2 datasets at $\sqrt{s}\ =$ 13 TeV. We consider a topology of fully hadronic top quark decay where each
top quarkâ€™s decay products are reconstructed within a single jet. We utilize deep neural network top tagging
to improve our sensitivity to these objects. In addition to adding the full Run 2 dataset, additional dark matter interpretations are added that have not been investigated before by CMS.
