A search for new massive particles decaying to a top quark-antiquark $t\bar{t}$ pair with 138 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data at $\sqrt{s}\ =$ 13.6 TeV is presented. We consider a topology of fully hadronic top quark decay where the decay products of the top quark are reconstructed within a single jet. We utilize a neural network-based top quark identification algorithm. In addition to adding the full Run 2 dataset, additional dark matter interpretations are added that have not been investigated before by CMS. The excluded mass limits are improved beyond the previous analysis~\cite{13tevZprime_CMScombo2015} by around 600 GeV in benchmark models. A Kaluza-Klein gluon decaying to top quark pairs is expected to be excluded below 4.5 TeV. A sequential standard model vector boson ($Z'$) decaying to top quark pairs is excluded below 3.9 TeV for a narrow width resonance (1\%), at 5.2 TeV for a moderate width resonance (10\%), 6.6 TeV for a wide width resonance (30\%), and 3.3 TeV for a $Z'$ Dark Matter mediator.
