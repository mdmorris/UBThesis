A search for new massive particles decaying to a top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) pair with 138 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data at $\sqrt{s}\ =$ 13 TeV is presented. The topology of fully hadronic top quark decay where the decay products are reconstructed within a single jet is considered, and a neural network top quark identification algorithm is employed. In addition to analyzing the full Run 2 dataset, dark matter interpretations are considered that have not been investigated before by CMS analyses. The excluded mass limits are improved beyond the previous analysis~\cite{13tevZprime_CMScombo2015} by around 600 GeV in benchmark models. The expected limit at 95\% Confidence Level for a Kaluza-Klein gluon decaying to top quark pairs is 4.5 TeV. A sequential standard model vector boson ($Z'$) decaying to top quark pairs is excluded below 3.9 TeV for a narrow width resonance (1\%), at 5.2 TeV for a moderate width resonance (10\%), 6.6 TeV for a wide width resonance (30\%), and 3.3 TeV for a $Z'$ Dark Matter mediator.
