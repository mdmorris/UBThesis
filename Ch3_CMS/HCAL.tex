\section{The Hadron Calorimeter}\label{sec:ch3:hcal}


The Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) is designed to absorb the energy from the hadronic particles. It is split in four sections: the barrel (HB), the endcap (HE), the outer calorimeter (HO), and the forward calorimeter (HF). The barrel (HB), covers $|\eta| < 1.3$, and the endcaps (HE), cover $1.3 < |\eta| < 3.0$. The HB is a sampling calorimeter of absorber (bronze) and scintillator (plastic). The brass absorber is divided into 36 wedges in $\phi$. The plastic scintillator is divided into 16 sectors in $\eta$. 

The HCAL has a limited distance between the ECAL and the solenoid to absorb the hadronic particles. For particles that are unable to be stopped in that distance, an outer calorimeter is placed outside the solenoid in the central eta region.

The HF has to withstand very high flux of particles. To handle this, quartz fibers are used as the calorimeter medium.
